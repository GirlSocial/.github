# GirlSocial - A new social network with the focus on inclusivity

GirlSocial will be an open source social platform unlike any other - with a focus on inclusivity.

You will be able to use GirlSocial air-gapped - like any existing social network, or you'll be able to enable integrations with services like pronouns.page and the software will try it's hardest to avoid making other people uncomfortable.

## Planned Release Date?

Unknown. We want to finish this as soon as we can, and have apps for all major platforms out. 

This is currently as of writing maintained by a single developer and support is welcome.
